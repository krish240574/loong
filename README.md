üêâ Loong Project is a collaborative effort to explore whether reasoning-capable models can bootstrap themselves from small, high-quality **seed datasets** by generating synthetic data and verifying LLM agent responses.

## Agent-Environment Loop

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/loongdiagram.png" alt="Project Loong Agent-Environment Loop" width="100%">
</div>

Project Loong leverages a **Generator** to create synthetic questions/answers from seed datasets, while a **Verifier** evaluates 
the correctness of those responses. A **Trainable Agent** then learns iteratively from these verified Q&As, enabling scalable 
self-improvement through reinforcement learning and more advanced strategies.

## üîç What's in this Repo?

#### 1. üìä **Seed Datasets** ‚Äî Real, human-vetted data from computable domains like math, physics, finance, etc.
#### 2. üìò **Cookbooks** ‚Äî Modular scripts for synthetic data generation, verification, and RL training loops.

<br>

## üìä Seed Datasets [‚Üí](./data)
A collection of **seed datasets**, structured for generation and verification, divded for each domain. 

Each datapoint includes:
- `question`
- `final_answer`
- `rationale` (typically code)
- `metadata` (license, source, domain, required_dependencies, name, contributor, date_created, difficulty, tags, anything else)

Each dataset is designed to allow automatic evaluation via **verifiers**, usually by executing the rationale code and comparing the output to the known answer.

###  Dataset Overview

The repository currently includes a total of **8,729 questions** spanning **12 diverse domains** (and growing!):

- üßÆ **Advanced Math:** 1,611 questions  
- ‚öõÔ∏è **Advanced Physics:** 429 questions   
- üß™ **Chemistry:** 3076 questions   
- üß¨ **Computational Biology:** 51 questions  
- üíπ **Finance:** 235 questions
- üéÆ **Game:** 926 questions
- üìà **Graph & Discrete Math:** 178 questions  
- üß† **Logic:** 1,054 questions  
- üìê **Mathematical Programming:** 76 questions
- üíä **Medicine:** 916 questions
- üîí **Security & Safety:** 516 questions
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Programming:** 585 questions

You can find each domain's dataset in the corresponding folder.

> Want to contribute your own? See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](data/CONTRIBUTING.md) for seed datasets.

<br>

## üìò Cookbooks [‚Üí](./cookboos)
Reusable scripts and notebooks for:

- Few-shot prompting from seed data
- Generating synthetic questions, rationales, and answers
- Running verifiers over generations
- Exporting datasets for supervised fine-tuning or RL

These pipelines allow you to condition generations on real data, verify outputs, and build consistent synthetic traces.

<br>

## üß¨ Contributuing to Project Loong üêâ

We're looking for:
- Seed datasets in verifiable domains
- New verifiers
- Cookbook improvements
- Experimental environments for RL
